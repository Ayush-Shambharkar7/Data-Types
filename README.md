# Data-Types

### Experiment 2
**Objective:**
To examine and verify different data types.

## Theory
Data types are essential in programming, defining the kind of data that can be stored and used within a program.

#### Data Types:
Primitive data types are the most basic, built-in types provided by programming languages for storing simple values.

##### 1. Integer (int): Whole number
Example: `int a = 2;`

##### 2. Float: A single-precision floating-point number.
Example: `float x = 5.9;`

##### 3. Double: A double-precision floating-point number.
Example: `double a = 5.97585858;`

##### 4. Char: Represents a single character.
Example: `char initial = 'A';`

##### 5. Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Example: `bool isStudent = true;`

#### 6. String Types:
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Example: `string name = "Mason";`

## Algorithm

* Begin

* Include the Necessary Headers

* Include the header files `<string>` and `<iostream>` for string and I/O operations. Use the standard namespace.

* Declare variables of various data types: int, float, char, bool, string, and double.

* Input and Output Operations

* For each variable:
  - Prompt the user to enter a value.
  - Read the input value.
  - Output the size of the variable using the `sizeof` operator.

* End

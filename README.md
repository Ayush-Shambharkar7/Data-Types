## Theory
Data types are fundamental to programming, providing a way to define the type of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program

#### Data Types:
Primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by a programming language. These are typically built-in and are used to store simple values.

##### 1. Integers (int): Whole numbers without a fractional part.
Example: int age = 25;

##### 2. Float: Single-precision floating-point number.
Example: float x = 5.9;

##### 3. Double: Double-precision floating-point number.
Example: float a = 5.97585858;


##### 4. Char: Represents a single character.
Example: char initial = 'A';

##### 5. Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Example: bool isStudent = true;

#### 6. String Types:
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Example: string name = "Alice";

## Algorithm 

* Start

* Include Necessary Headers

* Include the header files <string> and <iostream> to use string and I/O functionalities.
 Using Namespace

*  Declare variables of different data types: int, float, char, bool, string, and double.
   Input and Output Operations

* For each variable:
Prompt the user to enter a value.
Read the input value.
Output the size of the variable using the sizeof operator.
* End

## Conclusion 
We learnt to use the basic data types of C++.
